# Python-Fundamentals learning log
This repository tracks my journey as I master the foundational concepts of python for Data Science and AI.
The files here contain my practice exercises from my current course/ learning modules, covering:
- Basic syntax
- Data Types
- User Interaction and more as I progress!

My goal is to commit new practice files regularly to document my growth.
